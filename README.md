## Analysis

I would recommend Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio for inclusion in a firmâ€™s suite of fund offering.

Reason 1:

Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio has about 23.7% of total return in 7 years, which is about 4 times more than the Tiger Global Management's portfolio *(Which is about 5.5% return)*
![Cumulative Returns](cumulative_returns.png)

Reason 2:

After 2019, both portfolio has similar standard deviation (volatility). Berkshire Hathaway still has a little higher standard deviation, but compared to the market, the difference is minimal.

Reason 3:

Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio has higher sharpe ratio as well. That indicates it has better risk-return ratio, so taking the risk from the slight higher volatility would turn out better return.
